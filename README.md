# Webcam Security Application

This Python application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing webcam security, including functionalities for OTP-based login verification and webcam device control (enable/disable).

## Features

- **OTP Authentication**: Users can sign in using their email address, receive a One Time Password (OTP) via email, and verify it within the application.
- **Webcam Management**: Allows users to check the status of their webcam and disable or enable it based on their preference.
- **GUI Interface**: Built using a custom tkinter library (`customtkinter`), providing a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `smtplib` library (for email sending)
- `subprocess` module (for executing PowerShell commands)
- `random` module (for OTP generation)
- `threading` module (for asynchronous tasks)

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/webcam-security.git
   cd webcam-security
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if any additional dependencies are required):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

- **Sign In**: Enter your email address and click "Sign In" to receive an OTP.
- **OTP Verification**: Enter the OTP received via email and click "Verify" to log in.
- **Webcam Control**: Use the "Check Status", "Enable Camera", and "Disable Camera" buttons to manage your webcam's status.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with email delivery, ensure that your SMTP configuration (e.g., Gmail credentials) in `main.py` is correctly set up.
- For problems with webcam management, ensure that your system supports PowerShell commands for device control.
